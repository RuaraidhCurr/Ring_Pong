## How to play

Ring Pong involves two players and a ring of LED's.
There is a green light for each player on opposite sides of the LED Ring.
There is a single blue light that bounces around the led ring, between the players corresponding green lights.
The aim of the game is for each player to press their own button when the blue light comes within 2 leds of their green light.
This will fire the Blue led back along the led ring towards the other player where they will try do the same.
A point is gained when the opposite player fails to press their button when the blue led is within 2 spaces of their corresponding green LED.

## Changes we are making

1. Larger led ring.
2. IR sensors instead of buttons.
3. Adjustable game speed (the speed that the blue led goes at between the two players green LED's).
4. Point counter.
5. Adjustable max score.
6. Buzzing noises indicating a win and points gained.
7. LED light show on start-up and when someone wins.
8. Creating a nice portable case for the came.
